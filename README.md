# five-things-app
Five things is a an android application that teaches you five different fun facts about a particular topic.
I developed as a project for an Udacity android course to hone my skills as an android developer

Five Things gives you the option to choose whethere you are interested in learning 5 fun facts about either 'Science' or 'Sports'.
Depending on what option you choose, it launches an activity which teaches you the 5 fun facts.
